\noindent Firstly, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to our Jedi Master and mentor, Master Yoda, for being the guiding Force behind this endeavor. His wisdom and insight have been as illuminating as a lightsaber in the darkest moments. His constant guidance and inspiring words provided us with the clarity and courage to undertake and complete this mission. We are eternally indebted to him for offering timely advice, valuable critiques, and unwavering moral support throughout this journey.

We also extend our gratitude to the members of the Jedi Council (faculty members) for their support and wisdom in shaping our training as Padawans. We are equally thankful to the support staff, who, much like the droids in the galaxy, ensured everything ran smoothly behind the scenes. We are honored to have been trained in the hallowed halls of Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, our own Jedi Temple, which has been a beacon of knowledge and growth.

Our heartfelt thanks go to the beings (interviewees) from across the galaxy who took time from their busy intergalactic schedules to contribute to this research. Their cooperation was integral to the success of this endeavor.

Above all, we thank the Force for its guidance, our families for being the starships that carried us through this journey, and our friends for being the co-pilots we needed in times of doubt and difficulty.
